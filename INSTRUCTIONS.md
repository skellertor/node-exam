Node.js exam instructions
=========================

- Open a command line interface
- cd into the project directory
- Type `node index.js` or `node index.js {{comma delimited list of tags}}`
    - If you supply your own list of tags, delimit each tag with a comma
    and no additional space in-between the comma and next tag.
    - If you have any questions for me about why I did things a certain way, please ask.
